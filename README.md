This is an example Maven project implementing my Endotontic_Measurements plugin for ImagJ.

I have a working version of this Plugin, and it has already been used in some research:<br>
Jordal, K et al. (2021). Effects of an individualized training course on technical quality and periapical status of teeth treated endodontically by dentists in the Public Dental Service in Norway. An observational intervention study. International Endodontic Journal. ISSN 0143-2885. doi: 10.1111/iej.13669.

The plugin is now running in Eclipse but there might be some errors after I chagned some declarations because of warnings. Will go on debugging ...

# Purpose of the file:
The Plugin is used to mark landmarks as apex and stores the coordinates in a csv file for further analysis. There are also radiobuttons and free text fields for qualitative observations as PAI stored to the same csv-file. I will add a better description when I get the program to work.

Now it does not work anymore ...
